# Grunt/Gulp for Mendix theming

Make it easier to develop Mendix themes, without the use of [Scout](https://world.mendix.com/display/public/howto50/Create+a+custom+theme+with+the+Mendix+UI+Framework) or [Koala](https://world.mendix.com/display/public/howto50/Setup+Mendix+UI+Framework+with+Koala)

## Prerequisites (only need to do this once)

The following things need to be installed:
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [SASS & Compass](http://thesassway.com/beginner/getting-started-with-sass-and-compass) **<-- this is probably not necessary when using gulp-sass, we'll verify this later on**

If you want to use Gulp (recommended):
* [Gulp client](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md) (you can install this after installing Node using ```npm install gulp-cli -g```)

If you want to use Grunt:
* [Grunt client](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) (you can install this after installing Node using ```npm install grunt-cli -g```)

Note:
> We have provided both Grunt and Gulp, but we recommend you use the **Gulp version**. The reason for this is that Gulp works with pipes, which makes it extremely fast. In a few tests we did, Gulp performed the tasks in 150ms, while Grunt took 4 seconds. Yet, because there are people that use Grunt (and the first version of ux-theming only had a Gruntfile), we include this one as well.

## Installation

1.) Download the latest release (ZIP-file) [here](https://github.com/JelteMX/ux-grunt-theming/releases). **Do NOT download the source files, but choose Gulp.zip or Grunt.zip**

2.) Unzip the zip file in your project root folder so that package.json and package.xml end up in your root folder.

3.) Open a terminal and go to your project root folder.

_If you do this on Windows and you encounter errors with installing the dependencies, open your CMD or Powershell as Administrator._

4.) Install dependencies using ```npm install```

(**_If you use this for a Teamserver project, make sure you do not include node dependencies in you team-project: add the ``node_modules`` folder to your SVN ignore_**)

## Usage

Based on your choice between Gulp or Grunt, you have the following options:

* **default**, run from commandline:

```bash
  gulp
```

  or

```bash
  grunt
```

* **dev**, run from commandline:

```bash
gulp dev
```

or

```bash
grunt dev
```

The **default** task will check your theme folder (check Gruntfile.js/Gulpfile.js for the location) and will:
* copy changed .css files to your deployment folder
* when there are changes detected in any ```.scss``` file, run sass and place them in the source folder (on which these files will be copied to deployment as well)

The **dev** task will do the same as default, but it will start your browser through a [Browsersync](http://www.browsersync.io/docs/grunt/) proxy. Any changes that you make in the css files will be automatically injected in your browser. You do not have to manually refresh your browser.

## Modifying parameters

There are a few parameters that you can change. Open your ``Gruntfile.js`` or ``Gulpfile.js``, you can change these values at the top:

* ``sourceStyleFolder```
* ``deploymentStyleFolder```
* ``proxyAddress``

Make sure ``proxyAddress`` is pointed to your local deployment.

## Troubleshooting

* **``npm install`` fails**<br /><br />
  Make sure you have the package.json and Gruntfile.js/Gulpfile.js in your root folder. Also, if there are errors installing (this can happen when you install the Gulp version), make sure you have administrator rights. See point 3 at Installation.

* **"I started the dev task, but my ``localhost:3000`` keeps loading"**<br /><br />
  Have you pointed to the right local deployment address? Check the proxyAddress in your Gulp-/Gruntfile.js. This should correspond to the address of your local deployment.

## Done theming?

Clean your project folder by deleting:
* ```package.json```
* ```Gruntfile.js``` or ```Gulpfile.js```
* ```node_modules``` folder

## TODO

* Check if Sass & Compass are still necessary
